## About Me
I am a full stack developer. I love spending time on learning new languages of programming and frameworks in order to improve all time my knowledge. I like working in a team, I think it can help to everyone to learn from other people experiences and share ideas about how to fix problems. I started contributing with small applications on c++ and assember for university students.
